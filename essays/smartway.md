The essay "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric S. Raymond provides valuable guidelines for making inquiries that are not only able to produce useful responses but also make a more productive and respectful interaction with the open-source community. Understanding what makes a question "smart" versus "not smart" is crucial for software engineers, as it can affect both their personal growth and the efficiency for projects.

Smart questions are fundamental for several reasons. A well formulated question can reduce the time spent searching for answers. By clearly defining the problem and providing context, a smart question helps others understand exactly what information is needed, leading to quick and accurate responses. Asking smart questions help individuals learn more effectively. By framing questions in a way that demonstrates a genuine effort to understand and solve a problem, individuals can gain deeper insights and improve their problem solving skills.

## Asking Smart

Here is an example of asking a question the [smart way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63956323/fixing-the-size-of-a-custom-font-in-swiftui-ios-13-when-ignoring-dynamic-type). The asker clearly states what problem he is having. He is trying to fix the size of a custom font in SwiftUI while ignoring Dynamic Type. This clarity helps others to quickly understand the problem and provide relevant advice. The asker also provides proper details specific to the problem. The question specifies that the issue happens with SwiftUI on iOS 13. This detail is important because solutions may vary between different versions of iOS. The question also includes a code snippet that shows how the custom font is being used. Providing examples is fundamental for smart questioning because it allows responders to see exactly what the asker is working with. This helps them diagnose issues more accurately and suggest specific modifications or solutions.

### Asking Not Smart

Here is an example of asking a question the [not to smart way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78980726/match-any-time-in-the-iso-8601-format-between-064000-and-065959-am-utc). The asker fails to provide sufficient amount of context about why the time range needs to be matched or how the answer will be used. It mentions the need to match a specific time range in ISO 8601 format but does not specify if there are additional constraints or requirements, such as the format of the input or the expected output. The question also does not clearly provide enough example code indicate what the asker has already tried or why those attempts may have failed.
