Even though a coding standard seems trivial, after takingn ICS courses that focused on writing "clean" code, by providing a layout of how algorithms should be written in our code helped, me realize how important it can be. Having a consistent set of standards can lead to fewer errors, less confusion, easier readable code. This can help later when working in a group with multiple developers that are contributing to a shared project. If there was no coding standard, it can lead to chaos since there could be unreadable code that only the original author can fully understand. 

In addition to improving consistency by having a coding standard, I feel like it can help someone deepen their understanding of a language. After using ESlint with VScode, I found that it helped me understand errors I experienced while coding. For instance, avoiding unused variables, suggesting a better type definition like "const", or writing functions with clear input and output. While fixing these errors did get slightly annoying after awhile, it helped me build better programming habits and eventually writing more efficient code as I learned about more language features.

My experience with ESLint has been both challenging and rewarding. Initially, getting rid of all the ESLint errors felt tedious, as many errors seemed nitpicky. However, as I continued to work with it, I began to appreciate how these small corrections helped improve the overall quality of my code. ESLint's suggestions made my code more concise and easier to debug. It also cultivated a mindset of carefulness, where I started anticipating issues before ESLint could flag them. While the process of fixing errors can feel time-consuming at first, Iâ€™ve found it to be a valuable investment in long-term code quality.
